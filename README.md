# Messenger
A real time chat application

# Description
Messenger is a real time chat application, it enables you to communicate with your friends in private or in public rooms.    
For using the app you have just to create an account and choose your display name and then you are welcome to the chat community.

# Tools

I used React.js library to build the user interface and provide the single page application feature.    
For the state management, I utilized Redux store to provide the flow of data between components.

And for the server side I used Express.js framework along with node.js to manage the client requests, connect to the database and subscribe to socket.io server who allows users to enjoy this real time feature.

Finally, I used Mongoodb (mongoose), the NoSQL database structure to manage the users data and messages and performing all the necessary actions (selecting,finding...) along with GraphQl and Apollo
